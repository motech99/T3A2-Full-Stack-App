## Description

### Purpose

Company name is an activity rental stand located on the Gold Coast. Currently they do not have a website and as a result rely on a manual/paper booking system when people book in person. Not only do they rely on customers physically seeing the stand in order to make a booking, they have found that they have been leaving some customers disappointed as the equipment they came to hire was not available for them to use. As a result, they have asked us to create a website that allows their customers to view and book equipment in advance and additionally allows them to keep track of their bookings for each day. They believe that having a website where customers can see the equipment on offer and book online in advance, will not only increase their revenue but also increase the satisfaction of their customers.

### Functionality/Features

#### User Login and Registration Functionality

The app will allow users to register their details so that this information can be linked to their booking. Robust authentication procedures will be utilised to ensure confidentiality and security of user accounts. Users will have the ability to login to their account allowing them to view their past/upcoming bookings and make any required modifications (update/delete booking).

#### Equipment Listing

The application will have an equipment listing feature that will allow users to see all of the equipment they are able to hire. Users will be able to see a picture of the equipment, read a description, see a price and their hiring options (e.g. 1hr, 2hrs, full day etc.)
